# IRBD-Bank-Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the Power BI project "IRBD-Bank-Analysis" aimed at analyzing various banking metrics using advanced visualizations.

## Project Objectives
- Implement scalar visualizations with heatmaps, grayscale mapping, and dynamic SVGs.
- Utilize vector visualizations such as vector glyphs, vector color coding, and displacement plots.
- Provide actionable insights into banking data using Power BI's capabilities.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Business analytics tool for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics for dynamic visualizations.
- **DAX Queries**: Data Analysis Expressions for custom calculations in Power BI.

## Contents
- Scalar Visualization:
  - Heatmaps for visualizing bank counts and location correlations.
  - Grayscale mapping for attribute ranges like qualification.
  - Dynamic SVGs for interactive bank level representations.

- Vector Visualization:
  - Vector Glyphs: Using Route and Icon Map visuals for depicting payment method distributions.
  - Vector Colour Coding: Dynamically changing chart colors based on bank and disbursed amounts.
  - Displacement Plots: Scatter plots with play axis for visualizing purpose and amount changes over time.
